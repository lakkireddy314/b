Reasoned about optimized role restructuring for 19 seconds
Below is an example of an optimized version of the op_baw_upgrade role. This version has been restructured for:

Improved Exception Handling:
• Critical sections are wrapped in Ansible’s block/rescue/always constructs so that failures trigger an automated rollback.
• Each command uses explicit failed_when conditions and (where appropriate) retries with asynchronous execution.

Performance Optimizations:
• Independent backup tasks use Ansible’s asynchronous execution to run in parallel.
• Redundant operations are removed and tasks are grouped logically.

Enhanced Logging and Debugging:
• A log file variable is set at the beginning so that tasks can log outputs (or you can extend tasks to write to this file).
• Debug messages are inserted to help trace failures and execution flow.

Automated Rollback (Restore) Mechanism:
• If any upgrade step fails, the role automatically includes the restore tasks.

Modularization & Resource Cleanup:
• Tasks are split into separate files (backup, upgrade, restore, post_config, start_services, cleanup) for clarity and reusability.
• A cleanup task is run in an “always” block once the role completes.

Below is an outline of the updated directory structure and sample task files.

# op_baw_upgrade

## Overview

The **op_baw_upgrade** role automates and upgrades IBM Business Automation Workflow (BAW), IBM Websphere, IBM HTTP Server, and Web Server Plug-ins. This optimized version includes:

- **Exception Handling:**  
  Uses Ansible’s `block`/`rescue` to catch errors and automatically trigger a rollback.

- **Performance Optimizations:**  
  Backup tasks run asynchronously to reduce overall upgrade time.

- **Enhanced Logging:**  
  Log files are generated with timestamps and detailed debug messages are printed to help diagnose issues.

- **Automated Rollback:**  
  If any upgrade step fails, the role automatically restores directories from backups.

- **Modularization:**  
  Tasks are split into logical files (backup, upgrade, restore, post-config, start services, cleanup) for easier maintenance.

- **Resource Cleanup:**  
  Temporary files and logs are removed once the upgrade completes successfully.

## Usage

1. **Configure Variables:** Override defaults in your inventory or playbook (versions, repositories, backup flags, etc.).
2. **Run the Role:** Include in your playbook:
   ```yaml
   - hosts: your_target_hosts
     become: yes
     roles:
       - op_baw_upgrade
Rollback: In the event of an error, the role automatically runs the restore tasks.
Packaging: Package the role with:
bash
Copy
zip -r op_baw_upgrade.zip op_baw_upgrade/
Features
Idempotent tasks with conditional checks.
Automated backup, upgrade, post-configuration, and cleanup.
Parallelized backups using asynchronous tasks.
Detailed logging and error reporting.

### Packaging the Role

Once you have tested the role, package it for distribution:

```bash
zip -r op_baw_upgrade.zip op_baw_upgrade/
This restructured role should now be more robust, performant, and easier to troubleshoot, while automatically handling errors and rolling back changes if needed. Feel free to adjust commands and paths to match your environment.
